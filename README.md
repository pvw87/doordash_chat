* TLDR: *Build a chat app with real APIs*

### 1. Installing minimum deps
Make sure you have `node` installed, with a version greater than `7.0.0`. 
Once you have a good `node` installed, run `npm install` in this repo to get your dependencies.

### 2. Serving your app
Run `npm run api-server` to start the api and web server

Open the browser and goto localhost:8080 to view the chat application
